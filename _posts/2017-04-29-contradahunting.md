Despite not really starting my day until one in the afternoon, I managed to get a decent amount done today-- and by that, I mean that I walked for a little over 14 miles as part of a unique Sienese scavenger hunt.

Each of the seventeen <i>contrade</i> has its own church, museum, headquarters, and, most importantly for the hunt, a sort of "baptismal" fountain. Professor France's friend Anna Piperato, whom we met and who showed us her <i>contrada</i>, Lupa, came to Siena for the first time years before our own trip. She and several friends decided to explore each of the <i>contrade</i>, and as a way to prove that they had been to them, they decided to take a picture at each of the fountains in poses recreating those of the titular animals. While I opted not to pose for my pictures-- not being a fan of the camera-- I had a great time looking for each of the fountains with my friend Demoriya.

We started around two, and immediately headed for Tartuca, which I had found the other day when wandering aimlessly with a full cone of gelato. Tartuca's fountain, though not monumental, is nevertheless a pleasing little wall fountain

Next, we went to Chiocciola, or Snail, which I had also fortuitously found the day before

After taking a decent dinner break (where I experimented in the kitchen a bit and made a decent tagliatelle with a red-wine, red onion, and boar sausage sauce), we set out for Valdimonte, which, as it turned out, was setting up for a parade and dinner later that evening. We got to see the end of it, where all the Valdimontese entered their "parochial" church

Onda, or Wave, whose mascot is the dolphin, may actually be my favorite <i>contrada</i> simply based on first impression alone. It's a rather nice part of town, their fountain was very easy to find, and they included a helpful map of the contrada with a <b>QR code to a site to book a museum visit</b>. No other <i>contrada</i> had anything remotely similar, and as our visit to Selva showed, they don't seem particularly welcoming to outsiders. I certainly plan on visiting Onda's museum during my stay here, and who knows? Maybe I'll live in Torre for now but later cheer for Onda when the Palio occurs in July.

After making short work of Onda, we returned to Drago to complete the mission. I didn't want to go home having found only fifteen out of the total seventeen, as that would have seemed like such a
