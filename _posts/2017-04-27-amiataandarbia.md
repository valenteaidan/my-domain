Today's big news is that we had our first day-trip out of the city! Staying in Siena has been awesome, but it was rather nice to get out of the city for the day, much like Lexington (though Siena has much more in the way of food and entertainment options that Lexington does).

We went to a coffee roasting facility, a salumeria, and an olive oil farm.

The visit to the coffee roaster's as the first stop of the morning was a brilliant decision. While there, the wonderful owner of the facility (whose name nobody was able to catch) told us how his grandfather had bought the businness from the original starter, and how the logo for their coffee was a drawing of the founder's son, who the current owner met some time ago. He stressed how important tradition was to them, as he kept the receipt, business contract, and notice to the buyers that his grandfather originally held upon buying the very same machine he uses to this day.

He also showed us that he not only roasted coffee, but also a type of barley called "orzo"-- from which the pasta takes its name due to the similar shape, not the other way around-- which when brewed produces a vaguely similar, slightly sweeter and nuttier drink without any caffeine in it. I actually really enjoyed both it and the espresso he gave us, all freshly roasted and brewed before our very eyes, the wonderful jolt of caffeine notwithstanding.

Our bus driver whisked us off to our second destination, a salami and prosciutto factory called Il Borgo, which was certainly far less glamorous but presented a far tastier

Our final activity took longer to reach, as we went all the way down to an olive farm in the Val d'Orcia (near Montalcino and Montepulciano). Here, buffeted by a crazy wind that threatened to dump rain on us, we took a brief look at an impressive olive grove that covered the slopes of the hilltop that the farm is perched on.

One of the best parts about the trip as a whole so far is just how well I've been able to understand and, to a lesser extent, speak Italian here.
