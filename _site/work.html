<p><strong><em>Taming the Knights Templar: from Fighting Frescoes to Marian Murals</em></strong>:</p>

<p>This paper compares two image cycles in the Templar chapels of Cressac and Coulommiers, France. The former contains imagery related to the order’s militaristic mission in the Holy Land, while the latter, produced several decades later, emphasizes the Virgin Mary and scenes from her life. The difference in narratives parallels the evolution of the nature of the Templars over the course of their short but storied existence.</p>

<p><strong><em>Acca Larenzia and Rea Silvia: the Fonte Gaia and Its Complex Iconographical Themes</em></strong></p>

<p>An analysis of the Fonte Gaia in Siena, a masterful example of the transition in sculpture between the Late Gothic and Early Renaissance periods. The imagery of Jacopo della Quercia’s fountain connects themes of motherhood, civic and pious charity, and the appeal to Roman succession.</p>

<p><strong><em>All You Need Is An Onion</em></strong></p>

<p>A short paper examining the Induction of <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> and its importance in setting up the remainder of the play. Because it opens the play so uniquely but never resolves, the Induction introduces themes that affect the viewer’s perception of the play. The play-within-a-play framing device and contemporary views on women and acting imply that the typically misogynist messages of <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em>, when viewed in light of the Induction, may not apply so well to the play after all.</p>
