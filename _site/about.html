<p>My name is Aidan Valente, and I am currently a sophomore at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. Majoring in Medieval &amp; Renaissance Studies and Art History, I love studying European history and the beautiful art it inspired and influenced.</p>

<p>As a Mellon Digital Humanities Undergraduate Fellow, I incorporate methods of digital scholarship into my academic work, including my first major project, <em>The Commissione of Gerolimo Morosini</em>.</p>

<p>I have experience working in W&amp;Lâ€™s Special Collections with various rare books and early print pieces, as well as archiving practices such as cataloging and database managment. My particular areas of academic interest include the Knights Templar, the Venetian School of art, early music, and Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts and incunabula.</p>
