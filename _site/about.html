<p>My name is Aidan Valente, and I am currently a junior at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. Majoring in Medieval &amp; Renaissance Studies and Art History, I love studying European history and the beautiful art it inspired and influenced.</p>

<p>I am a contributor to Professor George Bent’s new digital humanities project <a href="florenceasitwas.wlu.edu">Florence As It Was</a>. I spent six weeks in Florence over the summer of 2017 working on the porject, and will continue to do so until I graduate.</p>

<p>I have experience working in W&amp;L’s Special Collections with various rare books and early print pieces, as well as archiving practices such as cataloging and database managment. My particular areas of academic interest include the Knights Templar, the Venetian School of art, early music, and Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts and incunabula.</p>
