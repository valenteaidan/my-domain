My name is Aidan Valente, and I am currently a sophomore at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. Majoring in Medieval & Renaissance Studies and Art History, I love studying European history and the beautiful art it inspired and influenced.
As a Mellon Digital Humanities Undergraduate Fellow, I incorporate methods of digital scholarship into my academic work, including my first major project, *The Commissione of Gerolimo Morosini*.
Particular areas on interest include the Knights Templar, the Venetian School of art, Medieval music, and Catholic Church architecture.
