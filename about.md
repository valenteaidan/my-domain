title: about

My name is Aidan Valente, and I am currently a junior at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. As a double-major in Medieval & Renaissance Studies and Art History, I love studying European history and the beautiful art it inspired and produced. I also plan to add a Classics minor shortly, and I have participated in the Mellon Undergraduate Fellowship for Digital Humanities since Fall 2016.

I am a contributor to Professor George Bent's new digital humanities project [Florence As It Was](http://florenceasitwas.wlu.edu/). I spent six weeks in Florence over the summer of 2017 working on the porject, and will continue to do so until I graduate. I also expect, by then, to have finished a digital edition of the [*Commissione of Gerolimo Morosini*](http://mackenziekbrooks.info/spt/texts/morosini_commissione/), a 17th-century Venetian manuscript in Washington and Lee's Special Collections.

I have experience working in Special Collections with other various rare books and early print pieces, as well as archiving practices such as cataloging and database managment. I have a wide range of academic interests, primarily revolving around Catholic art, history, and spirituality, as well as Medieval music and literature.
